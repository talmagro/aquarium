# Beginner Guide to

Beginners Guide developed to help new marine aquarium owners with their new hobby. These are the main for areas that need to be taken care of:

- Water
- Light
- Flow

## Water

### Temperature

The recommended water temperature is between 24 and 26 degrees celsius.

### Salinity

The recommended salinity levels are 1.024 – 1.025 (32 – 33 -34 -36 ppt). Itit is slightly below or above that level (1.022 – 1.027), the tank will be just fine.

Fresh water evaporates during the day, it needs to be topped off to mantain the salinity levels. Ideally the water will be purified RO/DI (Reverse Osmosis) water.

### Pollutants

The main marine aquarium ollutants are nitrides and phosphates. Large amounts are bad but small amouts are bad as well.

- Nitrate / Nitride below 5ppm, never keep levels above 40.
- Phosphate concentrations below 0.2 ppm 
- Ammonia

#### Nitrogen cycle

Ammonia (fish water and urine) -> Nitrite (nitrosoma bacteria convert Ammonia to nitrite) -> Nitrate (nitrobacter bacteria convert nitrite to nitrate)

When a new marine aquarium is started, it needs around a month to reduce the levels of ammonia and nitrates by adding benefitial bacteria during this period.

### Testing

Not only salinity need to be checked,

### Water Change

Corals take calcium as well so the water has to be changed every week to replenish them.

## Light

Corals live with just light. Too much light can kill the corals. Start low.

When the tank has fish, a protein skimmer is needed to keep it clean
 
### Testing the water



Add fish that eat algae to add filtration

# Flow is important

Add pum.
