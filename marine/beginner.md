# Beginner Guide to Marine Aquariums

Beginners Guide developed to help new marine aquarium owners with their new hobby. These are the components needed:

- Tank suitable for salt water
- Water Pump to enable water circulation and oxigenation
- Salt water, it can be bought from local shop or made at home
- Lights
- Filtration
  -  Live rock and live sand
  -  Sponge for particles (media like carbon or biomac can be added as well)

Note: Protein skimmers are not mandatory

## Cycling

During the first 2-6 weeks the tank needs to go through a cycling process, where a colony of bacterias needs to be stablished in the rocks and sand surfaces to reduce the levels of ammonia and nitrates by adding benefitial bacteria during this period. Tips for the process:

- First thing to put in the tank is the sand
- Then the rocks on top of the sand. Since there is no water yet, this is the best moment to think and play around with the rock placement. Avoid rocks touching the glass, this enables scrapping and removing algae in the future.
- Fill the tank with salt water
- Turn on the pump
- Lights don't need to be turned on and it's better if there is no filtration/media during the process since beneficial bacteria will also colonize it, and when they are changed, the bacterias will be removed.
- Add a benefitial bacteria solution following the fish shop guidelines.
- During the process (spring) water will evaporate, refill the tank with RODI water, not with salt water.
- The ammonia levels will spike, reaching above 1ppm, then it will turn into nitrite and finally nitrate. Again, this process usually takes several weeks. It is important to wait until your ammonia levels reduce to 0ppm before adding fish.
- If during the process you see algae, start a Clean-Up Crew. Snails can be added to eat them.

## Mainteinance

These are the main for areas that need to be taken care of:

- Water
- Light
- Flow

### Water

#### Temperature

The recommended water temperature is between 24 and 26 degrees celsius.

#### Salinity

The recommended salinity levels are 1.024 – 1.025 (32 – 33 -34 -36 ppt). It is slightly below or above that level (1.022 – 1.027), the tank will be fine.  
Fresh water evaporates during the day, it needs to be topped off to mantain the salinity levels. Ideally the water will be purified RO/DI (Reverse Osmosis) water.

#### Water Testing

Different parameters need to be checked besides salinity. Some if them are:

- Nitrate / Nitride below 5ppm, never keep levels above 40.
- Phosphate concentrations below 0.2 ppm 
- Ammonia
- PH
- Chlorine
- Calcium if you have corals that feed from it

Test your water at least twice per week.

#### Water Change

Change between 10 and 20% of the tank capacity every week to mantain pollutants level low.  
Corals take calcium as well so the water has to be changed every week to replenish them.

#### Light

Corals live with just light. Too much light can kill the corals. Start low.  
When the tank has fish, a protein skimmer might be needed to keep it clean.

#### Filtration

Add fish that eat algae to add filtration

#### Flow is important
