# Introduction

This document covers the research and maintenance schedule needed to keep the aquarium stable and suitable for any type of corals. This is the aquarium set up:

- Fluval Sea EVO 52L
- Filtration
  - Mechanical filter/sponge
  - BioMAX (changed every 6 months)
  - Activated Carbon (research needed to see if carbon is needed and if it absorbs beneficial dosed substances such)
- Stock pump
- Stock lights
- Lifestock
  - 2 clown fish
  - 1 fire shrimp
  - CUC

## Mainteinance Try 1

For the first try, anything is dosed into the aquarium. 10% water changes happen twice a week and water is measured before and after the water change. Salinity is mantained at 1.026.

## Mainteinance Try 2

Karwasse (calcium) / Alcalinity / etc. is dosed into the aquarium. 10% water changes happen twice a week and water is measured before and after the water change.
